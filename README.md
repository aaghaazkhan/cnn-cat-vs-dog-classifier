# cnn-cat-vs-dog-classifier
This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the EfficientNetB0 architecture to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on the Dogs vs Cats dataset from Kaggle, and data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance performance and improve robustness.
